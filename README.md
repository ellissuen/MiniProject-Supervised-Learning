# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning

## Project Description
Using data from "Diabetes" dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, this project aims to train a machine learning model to predict if someone has diabetes based on the # of pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes predigree and age.

## Process
1. EDA
2. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
3. Training ML Model
